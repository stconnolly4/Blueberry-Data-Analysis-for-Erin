# This Python script can be run in any Integrated Development Environment. It uses the Seaborn library, which is not always
# easy to get started with if you are not used to Python. If you have trouble getting the script to run, I recommend doing
# the following: Install PyCharm, open the file in Pycharm, go to Preferences, Project, Project Interpreter, +, search for
# Seaborn, and then click Install Package. I created a tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZWsVe2dBU8&t=1s
# On my YouTube channel you can find more tutorials for Pycharm and Python.

# first, let's import the Modules we will use
import csv
import Seaborn as sns

# now, let's read in the file. change this filepath and filename as necessary.
